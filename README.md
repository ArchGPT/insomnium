# Insomnium API Client

Insomnium is a 100% local and privacy-focus open-source API client for testing GraphQL, REST, WebSockets, Server-sent events and gRPC in development/production.

- ✅ works 100% offline, the way a local testing tool should behave <br>
- ✅ no cloud services, no tracking/communication to external servers behind the scene <br>
- 🦙 (coming up) optional integration to local LLMs like CodeLlama for front-end code generation in React, Vue, htmx, etc, based on the API response JSON

## Backstory

Insomnium is a fork of [Kong/insomnia at 2023.5.8](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnia), the last commit before compulsory account login was introduced. In a sense, Insomnium is a community response to [the latest product update that forces account creation w/o warning](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37680522).

![HN](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium/blob/main/hn.png?raw=true)

I was among the users who were deeply affected by the recent change. I still think Insomnia is a nice product in general, but I have to disagree with the direction it is going. So I have decided to fork it and make it 100% local and privacy-focus.

## Roadmap

I have removed user login, tracking, analytics, etc, from Insomnia so it is now a 100% local app. (And runs much faster!)

If you have any feature request or encountered any bug, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium/issues). Thanks! I'm also working on a Code Llama plugin for Insomnium to make it more easily customizable and extensible, while keeping the core product fast and 100% local-only. [You can read more about Insomnium's roadmap here](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium/discussions/13).

<details>
<summary>Initial Dev Setup</summary>

This repository is structured as a monorepo and contains many Node.JS packages. Each package has its own set of commands, but the most common commands are available from the root [`package.json`](package.json) and can be accessed using the `npm run …` command. Here are the only three commands you should need to start developing on the app.

```shell
# Install and Link Dependencies
npm i

# Run Lint
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run Tests
npm test

# Start App with Live Reload
npm run dev
```

### Linux

If you are on Linux, you may need to install the following supporting packages:

<details>
<summary>Ubuntu/Debian</summary>

```shell
# Update library
sudo apt-get update

# Install font configuration library & support
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig-dev
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fedora</summary>

```shell
# Install libcurl for node-libcurl
sudo dnf install libcurl-devel
```

</details>

Also on Linux, if Electron is failing during the install process, run the following

```shell
# Clear Electron install conflicts
rm -rf ~/.cache/electron
```

### Windows

If you are on Windows and have problems, you may need to install [Windows Build Tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Editor Requirements</summary>

You can use any editor you'd like, but make sure to have support/plugins for the following tools:

- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - For catching syntax problems and common errors
